\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ABSTRACT}
\section*{\centering \bf \large ABSTRACT}
\vspace*{20pt}
\par
\hspace*{12pt}Technology has changed the way job seekers search for jobs and employers
find qualified employees. While employers still advertise job openings through
traditional advertising mediums, today employers and job seekers turn to online
job portals to find employment matches. Job seekers can advertise their skills and
search for available positions and employers can announce employment openings
through job portals.\\

The proposed system ”WORK LORD” is a web based application to give the
job seekers a platform for finding right and satisfactory job according to their qualification and skills. It also connect the job seekers with the major companies. This application is mainly focused on the applicants, who are seeking jobs in CS (Computer
Science) field. Job seekers can register themselves with resume at the website where as the
employers register in the website and put job vacancies at their
company. Employers can also browse through the posted resumes and user performance. The system provides jobs catalogue and information to members. The Admin and employers can
keep the catalogue updated all the time so that the job seekers get the updated information all the time.\\

There are many job portals that claims to provide you the best job, but none
of them address the issues faced by the job seekers. They face issues because of work experience, because Companies give more priority for experienced job seekers. And they are not calculating the skill level of the job seekers. In this project we provide the Job Seeker to express their skills by completing the tests provided by admin which helps employer to understand their skills in their fields easily. Also they will
be getting tasks to complete for measuring their performance. Most
scored/skilled persons will be highlighted top and gets faster job opportunities such as preferred employer, preferred technology should be there. Calculating skills will be a great option for freshers to seek jobs. The issues faced by freshers can solved by implementing these features in the web application. The priority based oppertunities can be avoided by this. In our project we will be focusing on changing
such attitude towards freshers.\\

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\hspace*{12pt}The quality of people hired for a specific job is usually the key issue when measuring the effectiveness of the employment. However, in certain circumstances the speed of hiring is also an issue and also contribute to quality hiring. The rationale of a hiring process is to stretch out to potential employees and bring out the specific kind of required skills and experiences in the field organization. Online job portal system is fundamental in removal of paper works and introduction of workflow systems that connect job seekers and employers. At a very low cost, the internet offers employers and job searchers access to detailed and up-to-date information about job vacancies in different locations around the world. \\

WORKLORD project is aimed at developing a job portal friendly for non-experienced and experienced job seekers. The system project is an online web application which can be accessed from anywhere only with a proper login verification. Job seekers should be able to login and upload their resume and update their contact details. There are many job portals that claims to provide you the best job, but none of them address the real issues faced by the non-experienced job seekers. Companies give higher priority for experienced job seekers. They failes calculate the skill level of the job seekers. \\

 In this project we insist the Job Seeker to complete specific tests provided by the admin which helps employer to understand job seeker's skills and performance in their fields. Also they will be getting tasks to express their performance and efficiency. Most scored/skilled persons will be getting more priorities, Options such as top scored candidate, preferred employer, preferred technology should be there. Calculating skills will be a great option for freshers to seek jobs. The issues faced by the new job seekers to find a perfect job with their skills is difficult. In our project we will try to change such attitude from companies towards freshers. This system gives the company to search for the best candidate available on the fields.\\

\chapter{LITERATURE SURVEY}
\subsection{Job Procurement}

\hspace*{12pt}Old and New Ways Job seeking usually involves different ways to look for jobs such as through personal contacts, direct telephone calls to employers, job agency office, scanning online job listings etc. Before the Internet, became widely uses as a method of seeking jobs, jobseekers spent a lot of time using various methods to look for job openings. Today, jobseekers use online methods which are very convenient and save a lot of time. Eleanna Galanaki lists the following methods to be the traditional (old) ways for recruitment:
\subitem
\\ - Employment recruitment agencies
\\ - Job fairs
\\ - Advertising in the mass media such as newspapers
\\ - Advertisement in television and radio
\\ - Management Consultants
\\ - Existing employee contacts
\\ - Schools colleges or universities students services department
\\ - Workers or professional referrals \\

These old job seeking methods are too slow, stressful, challenging and also lack quality. In addition, the applicants have to consider the cost and the amount of time to get the information they need, and other preparations they have to make. Finding all available job vacancies is a main step at in the job-seeking process. The Internet is now a powerful tool that jobseekers can use. Today, there are many sites that advertise job positions to be filled by people with certain skills in various fields. The Internet plays an important role in the area of human resource planning and development. Most organizations are now using computer technology and the Internet for staff recruitment. Although the Internet has facilitated the process of job-seeking, it has not replaced the traditional methods, completely.

\subsection{Importance of Job Portals}

\hspace*{12pt}In the age of technology, the Internet has become the main source of information for jobseekers. Large corporations, institutions, and universities include information on career prospects on their websites. According to a survey, 70\% of the workforce uses websites or portals on the Internet to search for jobs in France. These websites or portals provide a search engine to access information on job opportunities. The most employers are keen to use online recruitment methods of getting staff. It mentions that the online recruitment methods have the ability to identify the best applicants. That is the reason why more developed countries such as Malaysia have started to use online job portal as one of the important way to recruit people to fill job vacancies. A study done in 2006, found that 21\% of internet users in the EU used the web to search for jobs or to send job applications. In 2007, this had increased to 67\% for unemployed people. \\


\subsection{Features of Job Portals}

\hspace*{12pt}One of the ways to improve employment mobility is to provide online job offer services. Online job portals can help jobseekers as they contain all required information about available vacancies in a single point. Such portals enhance efficiency in job recruitment as applicants can match their qualifications and skills to the requirements of employers. Generally, searching for jobs on the internet involves a process of information collecting because the job seeker gathers information contained in the job portals, during the search. A good job portal shares information and experiences with its members/users. This save time and efforts and better decisions can be made. Job openings requirements can be matched to an applicant's qualification and skills. In this way, job portals return not only the precise matches but also return the most similar match. The members of the European Commission (EC) stated that online job portals should have quite similar characteristics that include an online searchable database of positions for job searcher, facilities to send CVs to the website, email alerts of jobs which match the users profile, extra instruction, for example, about working in foreign countries or career guidance, the capability to manage job applications, employers must have the ability to publish and manage job positions, search the CV database, and have online contact with potential jobseekers.\\

\chapter{SYSTEM ANALYSIS}
\section{Existing system}

\hspace*{12pt}The traditional hiring of employees starts with the processing of application forms, describe the job for each position, verify application forms and lastly evaluate the best person for the job. The whole process from advertisement to hiring a quality applicant takes a lot of time, effort and also has more weakness. The advertisement itself is costly especially when done through print media. therefore, the publication of the job adverts will only last for a very short time and in that case few people will have seen the job vacancy. Thus, the traditional recruitment process is not be the best in today's competitive job market.\\

The question here is how this could be made efficient and possible. This question or problem solved by an online job portal system which is set to transform the way in which companies and other employers recruit their employees. The Job seeker Functions concentrates on the consistent information that is practically, part of the organizational activities and which needs proper authentication for the data collection. The users can perform some tasks without registering or without entering into the application. He can search for the jobs in the site. He can view the information which is available for the job seekers. Also view the walk-in details. The job seeker can perform some tasks only after entering into the application. In any situation the job seeker needs to change his password then he can change on his own. He can view the details of his own profile and he can modify his details in his profile. The employer can view his own profile and they can also post new job vacancies and they can view the candidates resumes applied for jobs. The admin functions concentrates on maintain the functionality of site. Proper management of complete job seeker section and employer section is his responsibility.\\

\section{Proposed system}
\hspace*{12pt}
The proposed system ”WORKLORD” is a web based application is to give the job seekers a platform for finding right and satisfactory job according to their qualification and skills. It also connect the job seekers with the major companies. Job Portal is a platform that joins recruiters and the job seekers to complete their goals and requirements. Recruiters look for a right candidate who has the right qualification to handle the responsibilities efficiently. On the other  hand, job seekers want a job where they can apply their skills and knowledge to grow their professional career. Most of the jobseekers who're actively seeking new employment opportunities are believed to be registered on multiple job portals. Finding a job opportunity per your choice and qualification through a job portal is relatively easier. There are many job portals that claims to provide you the best job, but none of them address the issues faced by the new job seekers. Most of portals give higher priority for experienced job seekers.\\

Job portals requires features like profile management, view notifications and other filtering options to match with the company with their skills. The users can perform some tasks without registering like he can search for the job vacancies,walk-in details which available in the notifications section. The job seeker can perform some tasks only after registration. After registering he can attend for tests and complete tasks. He can also view and modify his profile and also he can change his password. The employer can view their profile and they can post new job vacancies. They can also view the candidates resumes applied for jobs. The admin functions concentrates on maintaining the functionality of site. Proper management of complete job seeker section and employer section is his responsibility. He also provides tasks and updates test datas. Users analytics shows you a compiled listing of all users and the time they have spent using their Skills. Users analytics is one of the more important analytics sets when they are trying to calculate skills relating to an individual. We can check into a particular individual's peformance and see how they are performing. Many companies prefer employees with good experiences and reputation in their previous job rather than freshers. This causes issues with finding jobs for freshers with right skills. In this project we will be trying to change such attitude towards freshers. This system facilitate the company to search for the best candidate available and employ them as employers to improve efficiency on the employment sector.\\

\section{Feasibility Study}

\subsection{Operational Feasibility}

\hspace*{12pt} This Project is beneficial to people who wants to meet the qualifications of theirs and 
company's requirements. There's not much difficulty in, implementing the proposed system, It is so more effective, user friendly and functionally reliable to everyone. WORKLORD job portal is beneficial for every new job seekers, They can access this web portal from any where. This
website can be accessed from any devices like laptop or smartphone with internet connection. Any
of the user with good internet connection can register the website and complete tests and wait for right company to pick them up, users can make use of this portal by completing tasks which improves their skills.

\subsection{Technical Feasibility}

\hspace*{12pt}Technical Feasibility study deals with the hardware as well as software requirements. We have to determine whether the project done with the current technology has been examined in the feasibility study. The proposed system requires software like gedit and web server solution application called Xampp both are available for free. The website can also be easily upgraded to the higher level with less effort and maintenance. This website can be easily accessed with user's smartphone from anywhere
with internet connection and portal is very much user friendly. Hence the Proposed system is technically feasible.

\subsection{Economic Feasibility}

\hspace*{12pt}Economic feasibility determines whether the proposed system is capable of generating
profit for an organization. It involves cost incurred on the development team, estimated
cost of hardware and cost of performing feasibility study and so on, this website was developed with
the available resources. Since cost of input for the system is almost zero. The output of the website is
always a profit for the user and we see this as a service. This website doesn’t cost any charge from the job seeker who is accessing it. Since the
website can be accessed from any device with internet connection there is no need for a specific
hardware. Hence it is economically feasible.

\section{Implementation}

After testing, the proposed system is ready for the implementation. Implementation is the stage of the project when the theoretical design is turned in to a working
system. Implementation is the process of bringing a newly developed system or revised into operational one. The new system and its components are to be tested in a structured and planned manner. The implementation stage of a project is often very
complex and time consuming and many more people are involved in the earlier stages.
This involves careful planning, investigation of the current system and constraints of implementation, installing hardware, training the operating users in the changeover procedures before the system is setup and running. So, proposed system is easy to implement. It would be very easy to run also.\\

While implementing this system we only have few challenges. First challenge is to provide access to this webpage from anywhere or any device with internet access. For that we had to host the webpage in server with database access. If number users increase in this situation it won't affect as much as hosting in a local server. Most Hosting Providers have highly capable bandwidth and powerful computer to handle such traffic. The user must have a device with brower and stable internet access. Rest of the challenges are depended on the user, knowledge about using an electronic device and using it for accessing website. \\
